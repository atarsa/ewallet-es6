# Currency Converter 

Simple eWallet application that allows user to convert currencies and calculate the total. 

The data is stored in local storage.


Foreign exchange rates obtained via [Exchange Rates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/).

I used [Materialize Framework](https://materializecss.com/) for styling.

Live version can be found [here](https://atarsa.github.io/ewallet-es6/)
